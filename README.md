# GP2040-DADE

## Description

GP2040 Dual Analog and D-pad Edition is a fork of [GP2040-CE](https://github.com/OpenStickCommunity/GP2040-CE), and you should visit there to learn about most of the code and functionality.

## Modifications

This fork changes the behavior of GP2040-CE (primarily intended for fight sticks) from sending left stick, right stick, *or* d-pad to sending all three (by adding pins). This is to target a traditional controller.
